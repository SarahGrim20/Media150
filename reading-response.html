    <h2> 'In Plato's Cave' by Susan Sontag </h2>
    <p>The metaphor of 'Plato's Cave' refers to an allegory of men and women living chained inside of a cave, mistaking a shadow-puppet show on the wall for reality. When one person ventures out into the world and comes back to enlighten them, they don't believe him because he is stumbling in the dark, having become accustomed to the light. Susan Sontag describes how our society's preoccupation with photographic images mirrors the cavedweller's belief that the shadows on the wall were reality. Sontag fails to mention that if the man who left the cave came back with a photograph to prove the outside world existed, perhaps the cavedwellers would have believed him. She goes on to explain that photographs are not often accurate descriptions of reality, because they are appropriations and can be manipulated. I agree and I think the ambiguity around the reality of a photograph can be very damaging. However, the same can be said of written word or drawing. I believe the saying "a picture is worth a thousand words" isn't applicable to everyone. It may be a matter of personal preference and learning style that determines how either a photo or a written document or an artpiece will effect someone. Sontag points out that photos are easily manipulated. I do think this is a unique danger because it can be harder to tell when a photo is manipulated than to tell a writing piece is flawed. I especially think this is dangerous because of deep-fake technology which further disrupts the current political environment and because of AI, which plagiarizes the  work of others. That being said, I believe certain forms of experimental manipulation, when it is acknowledged the image is distorted, can combat some of the dark aspects of photography that Susan Sontag mentions, if the artist does not claim the image to be anything other than art. This is a method of photography I hope to use in class.  </p>
    <p>Sontag mentions that photography is typically used as "a social rite, defense against anxiety, or tool of power." I hope not to use photography in these ways. One way I hope to do that is by not posting my journalistic and photographic work on social media. I want to honor it by publishing it in a reputable news-paper or publication. Another practice I have is to capture images in my mind, so my experience of them is not altered by seeing the photograph. Despite my will to take precautions against photography, I feel that Sontag's criticisms that photography always contributes to a negative political environment to be false. There are many examples of photography being used to make social change, where I do not believe the photographer was "implicit" as she claims. For example, the photographer who took the famous photo "Tank Man" during the Chinese government's crackdown on student protestors. She also claims photography has elements of ownership, alteration and sexualization. I believe photography can be used in that way and often is, for example in the case of pornography or celebrity photoshop. These events are often dangerous but I also believe technology has space for free-will. In my work, I'd like to take non-posessive, non sexualized, realistic portraits of people who want their stories told. I think Susan Stonag leaves out room for this type of work in her writing.  </p>
