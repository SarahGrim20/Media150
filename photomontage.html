        <h1> Photo Montage </h1>
        <img src="FeministMontage3.jpg"  width="600">
<p> My montage shows contrasting images of stereotypical masculinity and femininity to confront gender norms and misogyny. It suggests issues of violence with the fist and the gun and with domestic life with the housewives and the suburban houses. It also references the feminist philosopher Marilyn Frye's theory of opression serving as a bird cage for women with the bird cage imagery. In that image, the birds are being freed, which conveys a message of hope. Another reference in this is Courtney Love, in the bottom left, who demonstrates a wild and chaotic brand of feminism that contrasts with that of the housewives. The pearl necklace shows the fragility and expectations involved with being a woman.  </p>
<p> I used multiple layers attached with multiple different settings to portray this work. I overlapped images with little room for background to overwhelm the viewer and used blending to make it cohesive. I added layers with high contrast and saturation to increae the intensity of the messaging, and created a pink tint to highlight the feminist meaning. I used images from the web and from public domain.</p>
