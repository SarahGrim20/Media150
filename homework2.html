          <p>For this image, I adjusted the levels to make the brightest light come from the end of the hallway, drawing your eye in that direction and matching the golden ratio technique. I adjusted the tone to be closer to cyan and blue to give the image an eery feel. I also darkened the space outside the hallway with curves to draw more attention to the light. I accomplished all this through creating multiple layers and setting it to 16 bits. In the end, I wanted it to be reminiscent of a hospital or a generally unsettling place.</p>  </p>

          <p>I wanted this image to draw attention to the red fire extinguisher as much as possible. I used the rule of thirds to adjust the cropping of the image and place the extinguisher to the side. Then I adjusted the curve and levels so that the background would be brighter and the darkest point would be the extinguisher. I adjusted the saturation and hue to deepen the red and increased the color and vibrance. I increased the contrast and decreased the brightness to draw even more attention to the extinguisher. In the end, I think I achieved my goal of having a strong and bright focal point.  </p>
