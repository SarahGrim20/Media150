         <h1>Into the Unknown</h1>
          <img src="Hallway .JPG" alt="Hallway" width="600">
          <br>
          <p>For this image, I adjusted the levels to make the brightest light come from the end of the hallway, drawing your eye in that direction and matching the golden ratio technique. I adjusted the tone to be closer to cyan and blue to give the image an eery feel. I also darkened the space outside the hallway with curves to draw more attention to the light. I accomplished all this through creating multiple layers and setting it to 16 bits. In the end, I wanted it to be reminiscent of a hospital or a generally unsettling place.</p>  </p>

          <h1>Get Help</h1>
          <img src="Extinguisher2.jpg" alt="Extinguisher2" width="600">
          <br>
          <p>I wanted this image to draw attention to the red fire extinguisher as much as possible. I used the rule of thirds to adjust the cropping of the image and place the extinguisher to the side. Then I adjusted the curve and levels so that the background would be brighter and the darkest point would be the extinguisher. I adjusted the saturation and hue to deepen the red and increased the color and vibrance. I increased the contrast and decreased the brightness to draw even more attention to the extinguisher. In the end, I think I achieved my goal of having a strong and bright focal point.  </p>

          <h1>AI Slop Response</h1>
          <p>It seems Nesrine Malik's point in “With ‘AI slop’ distorting our reality, the world is sleepwalking into disaster” is that AI content is overwhelming and diverting us from reality. Political figures can be propped up by otherworldly images of them as giant golden statues, or standing in raining money. Their ideologies can be spread by videos of Latino men and women being deported, or of ‘trad wives’ cooking. In one case, Trump’s policy was enacted in an AI video of him sitting in Gaza, transformed into a resort. Many of these videos and images are highly improbable, and I agree that they can stoke the flames of fantasy for some, and hatred for others. They make me feel disgust toward our current administration and the right-wing ideology they are spreading and scared of how social media, a tool primarily used by youth, is being weaponized. Some videos, like the video of Donald Trump dropping sewage on protestors, are so unthinkable that they make me feel like the administration can do anything they want. Internet trends like the ‘trad wife,’ a woman who returns to a ‘traditional’ subservient lifestyle or the blonde-haired blue-eyed family can be taken to new levels. These images dishearten people who have to confront this ideology is now the new normal. I think of the young people and children who are currently interacting with this media environment, and how scary some of these images might be. These images also numb people to real images of disaster happening. There’s so much going on we don’t know what to take in. The real begins to look unreal and the unreal begins to look real. </p>
<P></P>It all begs the question: what is the role of photography in this? Are true images being de-valued by false images? And in this climate, is all photography a political tool? Photography is no longer a trusted way for people to perceive things going on in other parts of the world. The role of visual art, as well, is changing as people spend less time observing and more time scrolling. As a photographer, I often no longer want to take photos because of the massive stream of photos that already exist. And promoting my visual art on social media feels preformative, and like it would get lost in a sea of other images. There is a niche of people who want genuine images, but these people often don’t know where to find them. I feel lucky that I live in a city like New York City where I can go to museums and appreciate imagery that has true artistic value.
<p>Maybe people will have to start putting disclaimers in their posts that they are either AI or real content. Perhaps there will be a new way of reporting AI or offensive content. I hope that AI doesn’t entirely take over our critical thinking skills, and we can still decide for ourselves what content we want to engage with and not engage with. For me, I will not be using social media, but will be engaging with the news and real images that have value to me.
